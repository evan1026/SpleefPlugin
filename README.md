#SpleefPlugin

##Installation

To install, download the most recent jar from [the downloads page](http://bit.ly/SpleefDownloads) (currently 1.2) and save it into your plugins directory. Bukkit will do the rest.  

And hey, while you're downloading, vote in this [poll](http://poll.pollcode.com/t1tpil). I'm deciding if i want to go through all of the pain to rewrite the code when people might not even use it.

##Commands & Permissions

Got that stuff in the [wiki](https://github.com/evan1026/SpleefPlugin/wiki)
