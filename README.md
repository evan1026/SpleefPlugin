#SpleefPlugin

A bukkit plugin that enhances spleef by allowing instant breaking of blocks without giving users creative mode, thus also giving the ability to build the arena out of any desired material, rather than limiting it to snow. This plugin also allows the arenas to be named and it allows moderators to reset the blocks within an arena with one simple command.

##Installation

To install, download the most recent jar from [the downloads page](http://adf.ly/Mewh5) that corresponds to your bukkit installation and save it into your plugins directory. Bukkit will do the rest.
